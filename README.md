# ACL
ACL (Almond's Class Library) is a Monogame class library made with the purpose of simplyfing the creation of a new DesktopGL project by providing a simple base for 2D user interfaces, physics and more. This includes :
- A component class which lets you create your own UI elements.
- Built-in UI components.
- File manipulation within the project's directory.
- JSON serialization/deserialization.
